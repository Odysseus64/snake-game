## Snake DSK-Game
Snake in Java is a classic game in which the player controls a snake, collecting food and avoiding collisions with walls and his own tail. The player must constantly move forward, otherwise the game will be lost.

The goal of the game is to collect as much food as possible and get points for it. With each piece eaten, the snake becomes longer, which complicates its management. If the snake collides with a wall or its own tail, the game is over.

The game is implemented in Java using the Swing graphics library. The snake is represented as a chain of rectangles that constantly move around the playing field. Food is randomly placed circles on the field, which the snake must "eat" in order to increase its length and get points.

The player controls the snake using the keys on the keyboard. Depending on the chosen direction, the snake turns left or right, or continues to move straight. With each level of difficulty of the game, the speed of the snake increases, and food becomes more rare.

Snake in Java is an exciting game that will help develop logical thinking, coordination of movements and reaction.
